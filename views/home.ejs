          <p>Until now, crypto has mostly been a solution looking for a problem.</p>
          <p>We flipped the coin and went looking for good problems to solve, with crypto.</p>
          <p>Our methodology is to talk to people and build solutions that meet their needs. Over the past months we interviewed hundreds of people about their online behaviors, looking for gaps where crypto could move the needle in a big way. We continue to have these conversations every day; it’s essential to our building stuff that people value.</p>
          <p>Pepo is the best crypto user experience ever made. It’s blazing fast. Simple. Human. It removes many of the icky bits that have limited crypto mass-adoption, while making crypto about the people, not just the technology. It’s an app the entire movement can get behind.</p>
          <p>We designed Pepo to help the crypto community come together, support each other, lift the discourse, and have some fun.</p>
          <p>Today, Pepo combines decentralized and centralized elements. Keys are private and non-custodial. Transactions are 100% on chain. As we progress and learn, we plan to decentralize more and more, towards Pepo being fully community powered.</p>
